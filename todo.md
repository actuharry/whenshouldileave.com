## TODO:

- You are not allowed to use any CSS styling frameworks to implement your app, but I see Tailwind CSS code in your repository. Please remove all styling libraries and implement your app using your own CSS. This will demonstrate your CSS skills to potential employers.
- You app is required to have a mobile-first design. One implication of that requirement is that I should not have to or be able to scroll horizontally when viewing your app at a mobile screen resolution. Currently, I am able to scroll horizontally. Modify your CSS to correct this issue. screenshot
- Please modify you CSS to make better use of the limited screen real estate on mobile devices. You currently have a lot of unused screen area: screenshot
- Remove all diagnostic JavaScript console log messages from your source code. While helpful during development they should be removed in a production environment. For example - I saw these message(s) in the console when running your app:
  - yellow ResultsPage.js:160 3.388189738625358
- The Email Results link did not do anything when I clicked on it.
- The Share link did not do anything when I clicked on it.
- You are required to include a smoke test for each component in the React client. For example, I was expecting to find a smoke test for this component but was unable to do so. - Please add the missing tests and resubmit your app.
- This file is too large. Please break up the source code in that file such that each React component has its own file. Each React component should also have a corresponding test file that contains the tests for that component.
- I couldn't find your API tests. You are required to include at least one test for each back end endpoint service. For example, I was expecting to find a test for this service but I was unable to do so. Please add any missing tests and resubmit your app.
- I noticed that you have commented-out code here. Unused code in comments clutters the actual source code and makes it harder to read. Please remove all commented-out code in both repositories.
- I could not find any descriptive comments in your source code, which is a requirement for this assignment. Please add some. You could for example, explain the purpose of each React component and API service.

## DONE:

- Your App and API code need to be in separate GitHub repositories.
- Your app is required to have a custom favicon. Please add one. Adding a custom favicon to your site makes it stand out among the other tabs that the user might have open. A favicon will also eliminate the corresponding console error that occurs when the browser attempts to load the missing favicon.
- You are required to include a detailed readme.md in your app's repo including:
  - link to the live app
  - description of app
  - screenshots of app
  - documentation of the API Please proofread your app's readme.md and add any missing information.
- You are required to include a detailed readme.md in your API's repo including:

  - the name of the app at the top of the file
  - a link to the live project
  - the name and description of each API end point service
  - documentation of each endpoint's inputs and outputs
  - screenshot(s) of the app
  - a summary section with a concise explanation of what the API does
  - a section on the technology used to implement your API Please add any missing information.
